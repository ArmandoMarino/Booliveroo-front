                        <p class="py-3">When Booliveroo's founder and CEO Will Shu moved to London in 2013 he discovered a
                            city full of
                            great restaurants, but he was amazed that so few of them delivered food. He made it his personal
                            mission to bring the best local restaurants direct to peopleâ€™s doors.

                            Today, Booliveroo operates a hyperlocal three-sided marketplace, connecting local consumers,
                            restaurants and grocers, and riders to fulfill a mission critical, emotional purchase in under
                            30 minutes. By offering fast and reliable delivery which consumers can track online, Booliveroo
                            has grown rapidly. Booiveroo now operates in 11 markets worldwide, working with thousands of
                            restaurants and grocers, thousands of riders, and serving millions of consumers.</p>
